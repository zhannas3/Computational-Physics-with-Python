In the last part, the execution time of these operations above were calculated and there was made an analysis based on that information. \n","Actually, functions that were used to find maximum, minimum and average values were very similar for lists and arrays. Also, both lists and arrays were printed in a similar way. However, there are some differences between them in terms of efficiency and structure. \n","Firstly, lists are considered as more flexible, whereas in arrays: size of numpy arrays and type of variables are fixed. \n","However, arrays are more compact than lists in terms of memory. Because lists can contain objects of different types so that Python has to store memory for each element. \n","Also, elementwise arithmetic and vector operations are conducted easier in arrays than lists. \n","So, there arises the question of efficiency. Generally, it was found that arrays are more efficient than lists. It can be concluded based on the infomration about the execution time in different functions of maximum, minimum and average. Since, the time differed in each case, there was a need to execute several times in order to achieve more accurate results. And on average, there was only huge difference on sum of two lists/arrays, about 100-120 ms, which shows that arithmetic operations are easier to be handled in arrays. However, there was a slight difference on maximum, minimum and average, around 20-30 ms. "]}]}
